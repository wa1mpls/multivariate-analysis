# 📊 Multivariate Data Analysis Labs (Python)

This repository contains 5 completed labs for a course in **Multivariate Statistical Analysis**, implemented in **Python**. Each lab includes source code, real-world datasets, statistical visualizations, and a detailed report in both DOCX and PDF format.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each `labX/` folder contains:

- `source/` – Python scripts implementing the analysis
- `data/` – Input dataset in CSV format (if used)
- `graph(s)/` – Output visualizations (e.g., bar chart, heatmap, scree plot)
- `doc(s)/` – Report and documentation (DOCX + PDF)

## 🧪 Lab Summary

| Lab   | Dataset Used            | Key Techniques Applied                      |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `lab1` | None (basic script)      | Basic statistical analysis structure        |
| `lab2` | `covid-19-cases.csv`     | Time-series plotting, bar charts            |
| `lab3` | `wine.csv`               | Correlation analysis, multivariate stats    |
| `lab4` | `bfi.csv`                | PCA (Principal Component Analysis)          |
| `lab5` | Canonical correlation    | Heatmaps, canonical correlation coefficients|

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data wrangling with `pandas`
- Statistical visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- PCA and canonical correlation analysis
- Custom plotting and interpretation scripts

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Navigate into each `labX/` folder
2. Run Python scripts in `source/` (e.g., `main.py`, `plot.py`)
3. Ensure required libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## 📑 Reports

Each lab is accompanied by a PDF and DOCX report:
- Written in English or Vietnamese
- Includes figures, interpretations, and conclusions
